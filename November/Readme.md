### What it is?
The Kaye Validator AVS is primarily designed for precise thermal validation and temperature mapping.
Additional parameters such as  humidity can also be measured using compatible Kaye modules and ValProbe Real Time (RT) loggers.
It provides secure, audit-ready data for regulatory compliance with FDA, GMP, and ISO standards.
The system supports up to 4 Sensor Input Modules (SIMs) in a thermal validation study — offering 48 input channels to perform multiple studies simultaneously.

### Applications

The Kaye Validator AVS and ValProbe RT systems are designed for qualification and validation of a wide range of thermal processes and controlled environments, including:

- **Steam Sterilizers (Autoclaves):** Validation of sterilization cycles and temperature uniformity.  
- **Dry Heat Sterilizers:** Monitoring high-temperature depyrogenation or dry heat processes.  
- **Steam-in-Place (SIP) Systems:** Validation of steam sterilization directly in process piping or vessels.  
- **Water Cascade / Water-Fall Sterilizers:** Ensuring uniform heat distribution in water-based sterilization systems.  
- **Incubators:** Verifying controlled temperature and humidity conditions for cell growth or storage.  
- **Stability Chambers:** Mapping long-term stability testing environments.  
- **Freezers:** Temperature mapping of low-temperature storage and cryogenic units.  
- **Freeze Dryers (Lyophilization):** Monitoring and validating temperature and pressure during the freeze-drying process.  
- **Process Vessels:** Measuring and validating temperature uniformity in large tanks.
